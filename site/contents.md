title: Cheap Lit Done Quick!

[A warning from Rudyard Kipling](./copybook-headings.html).

## Because you didn't know how much you needed the Western Canon.

We live in an age, you and I, when the Traditions of the West have been
disparaged, trashed, thrashed, folded, spindled, and mutilated.

Our literature, the Western Canon, is a treasure immeasurable. But how many of
us are familiar with it any more? We've been told it is worthless. We've been
told it is poisonous. 

We've been told lies and slander. In the immortal words of Stevie Wonder, "I
ain't gonna stand for it."

The Western Canon is our cultural patrimony, the pinnacles of the English
language that inspired our forefathers (literal and cultural). Any man, woman,
or child who benefits from Western Civilization would do well to acquaint
himself with this heritage.

Like the 6th and 7th century monks who saved much of classical literature out
of the wreckage of Rome, today we have countless individuals who have toiled to
digitize much of the public domain. Through efforts like Project Gutenberg and
Christian Classics Ethereal Library, anybody with enough time and patience can find all
the old classics online.

But few have the time or patience.

CLDQ is about ferretting out the very best of those classics and repackaging
them for easy access in the modern world. The texts may be difficult, but they
*must* be accessible.

Read these classics of our shared culture. Savor them. Let the clear, ringing
voice of the past, speaking the very best words our ancestors had to offer,
inspire you.

The Canon was ever at your service. Take it up again.

## “Cheap Lit”?

Cheap, as in priceless. Cheap, as in free: free to read and cherish. Free, as
in Freedom. (Free, as in beer, too.)

## “Done Quick”?

Most of the hard work of transcribing, digitizing, and proofing has already
been done. CLDQ comes in for the glory, selecting the very best, slapping a
nice finish on it, and presenting it to you, dear reader, for your edification.
