<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

David was the penman of most of the psalms, but some evidently were composed by other writers, and the writers of some are doubtful. But all were written by the inspiration of the Holy Ghost; and no part of the Old Testament is more frequently quoted or referred to in the New. Every psalm either points directly to Christ, in his person, his character, and offices; or may lead the believer's thoughts to Him. And the psalms are the language of the believer's heart, whether mourning for sin, thirsting after God, or rejoicing in Him. Whether burdened with affliction, struggling with temptation, or triumphing in the hope or enjoyment of deliverance; whether admiring the Divine perfections, thanking God for his mercies, mediating on his truths, or delighting in his service; they form a Divinely appointed standard of experience, by which we may judge ourselves. Their value, in this view, is very great, and the use of them will increase with the growth of the power of true religion in the heart. By the psalmist's expressions, the Spirit helps us to pray. If we make the psalms familiar to us, whatever we have to ask at the throne of grace, by way of confession, petition, or thanksgiving, we may be assisted from thence. Whatever devout affection is working in us, holy desire or hope, sorrow or joy, we may here find words to clothe it; sound speech which cannot be condemned. In the language of this Divine book, the prayers and praises of the church have been offered up to the throne of grace from age to age.

<p>Save me, O God; for the waters are come in unto my soul.</p>

<p>I sink in deep mire, where there is no standing: I am come into deep waters, where the floods overflow me.<sup title="deep mire: Heb. the mire of depth">1</sup><sup title="deep waters: Heb. depth of waters">2</sup></p>

<p>I am weary of my crying: my throat is dried: mine eyes fail while I wait for my God.</p>

<p>They that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of mine head: they that would destroy me, being mine enemies wrongfully, are mighty: then I restored that which I took not away.</p>

<p>O God, thou knowest my foolishness; and my sins are not hid from thee.<sup title="sins: Heb. guiltiness">3</sup></p>

<p>Let not them that wait on thee, O Lord GOD of hosts, be ashamed for my sake: let not those that seek thee be confounded for my sake, O God of Israel.</p>

<p>Because for thy sake I have borne reproach; shame hath covered my face.</p>

<p>I am become a stranger unto my brethren, and an alien unto my mother’s children.</p>

<p>For the zeal of thine house hath eaten me up; and the reproaches of them that reproached thee are fallen upon me.</p>

<p>When I wept, and chastened my soul with fasting, that was to my reproach.</p>

<p>I made sackcloth also my garment; and I became a proverb to them.</p>

<p>They that sit in the gate speak against me; and I was the song of the drunkards.<sup title="drunkards: Heb. drinkers of strong drink">4</sup></p>

<p>Let not the waterflood overflow me, neither let the deep swallow me up, and let not the pit shut her mouth upon me.</p>

<p>Hear me, O LORD; for thy lovingkindness is good: turn unto me according to the multitude of thy tender mercies.</p>

<p>Draw nigh unto my soul, and redeem it: deliver me because of mine enemies.</p>

<p>Reproach hath broken my heart; and I am full of heaviness: and I looked for some to take pity, but there was none; and for comforters, but I found none.<sup title="to take…: Heb. to lament with me">6</sup></p>

<p>They gave me also gall for my meat; and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.</p>

<p>Let their table become a snare before them: and that which should have been for their welfare, let it become a trap.</p>

<p>Let their eyes be darkened, that they see not; and make their loins continually to shake.</p>

<p>Pour out thine indignation upon them, and let thy wrathful anger take hold of them.</p>

<p>But I am poor and sorrowful: let thy salvation, O God, set me up on high.</p>

<p>I will praise the name of God with a song, and will magnify him with thanksgiving.</p>

<p>This also shall please the LORD better than an ox or bullock that hath horns and hoofs.</p>

<p>The humble shall see this, and be glad: and your heart shall live that seek God.<sup title="humble: or, meek">11</sup></p>

<p>Let the heaven and earth praise him, the seas, and every thing that moveth therein.<sup title="moveth: Heb. creepeth">12</sup></p>

<p>Give ear, O my people, to my law: incline your ears to the words of my mouth.<sup title="Maschil…: or, A Psalm for Asaph to give instruction">1</sup></p>

<p>I will open my mouth in a parable: I will utter dark sayings of old:</p>

<p>Which we have heard and known, and our fathers have told us.</p>

<p>We will not hide them from their children, shewing to the generation to come the praises of the LORD, and his strength, and his wonderful works that he hath done.</p>

<p>For he established a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law in Israel, which he commanded our fathers, that they should make them known to their children:</p>

<p>That the generation to come might know them, even the children which should be born; who should arise and declare them to their children:</p>

<p>That they might set their hope in God, and not forget the works of God, but keep his commandments:</p>

<p>And might not be as their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation; a generation that set not their heart aright, and whose spirit was not stedfast with God.<sup title="that…: Heb. that prepared not their heart">2</sup></p>

<p>The children of Ephraim, being armed, and carrying bows, turned back in the day of battle.<sup title="carrying: Heb. throwing forth">3</sup></p>

<p>They kept not the covenant of God, and refused to walk in his law;</p>

<p>And forgat his works, and his wonders that he had shewed them.</p>

<p>Marvellous things did he in the sight of their fathers, in the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan.</p>

<p>He divided the sea, and caused them to pass through; and he made the waters to stand as an heap.</p>

<p>In the daytime also he led them with a cloud, and all the night with a light of fire.</p>

<p>He clave the rocks in the wilderness, and gave them drink as out of the great depths.</p>

<p>He brought streams also out of the rock, and caused waters to run down like rivers.</p>

<p>And they sinned yet more against him by provoking the most High in the wilderness.</p>

<p>And they tempted God in their heart by asking meat for their lust.</p>

<p>Yea, they spake against God; they said, Can God furnish a table in the wilderness?<sup title="furnish: Heb. order">4</sup></p>

<p>Behold, he smote the rock, that the waters gushed out, and the streams overflowed; can he give bread also? can he provide flesh for his people?</p>

<p>Therefore the LORD heard this, and was wroth: so a fire was kindled against Jacob, and anger also came up against Israel;</p>

<p>Because they believed not in God, and trusted not in his salvation:</p>

<p>Though he had commanded the clouds from above, and opened the doors of heaven,</p>

<p>And had rained down manna upon them to eat, and had given them of the corn of heaven.</p>

<p>Man did eat angels’ food: he sent them meat to the full.<sup title="Man…: or, Every one did eat the bread of the mighty">5</sup></p>

<p>He caused an east wind to blow in the heaven: and by his power he brought in the south wind.<sup title="to blow: Heb. to go">6</sup></p>

<p>He rained flesh also upon them as dust, and feathered fowls like as the sand of the sea:<sup title="feathered…: Heb. fowl of wing">7</sup></p>

<p>And he let it fall in the midst of their camp, round about their habitations.</p>

<p>So they did eat, and were well filled: for he gave them their own desire;</p>

<p>They were not estranged from their lust. But while their meat was yet in their mouths,</p>

<p>The wrath of God came upon them, and slew the fattest of them, and smote down the chosen men of Israel.<sup title="smote…: Heb. made to bow">8</sup><sup title="chosen…: or, young men">9</sup></p>

<p>For all this they sinned still, and believed not for his wondrous works.</p>

<p>Therefore their days did he consume in vanity, and their years in trouble.</p>

<p>When he slew them, then they sought him: and they returned and enquired early after God.</p>

<p>And they remembered that God was their rock, and the high God their redeemer.</p>

<p>Nevertheless they did flatter him with their mouth, and they lied unto him with their tongues.</p>

<p>For their heart was not right with him, neither were they stedfast in his covenant.</p>

<p>But he, being full of compassion, forgave their iniquity, and destroyed them not: yea, many a time turned he his anger away, and did not stir up all his wrath.</p>

<p>For he remembered that they were but flesh; a wind that passeth away, and cometh not again.</p>

<p>How oft did they provoke him in the wilderness, and grieve him in the desert!<sup title="provoke: or, rebel against">10</sup></p>

<p>Yea, they turned back and tempted God, and limited the Holy One of Israel.</p>

<p>They remembered not his hand, nor the day when he delivered them from the enemy.<sup title="from…: or, from affliction">11</sup></p>

<p>How he had wrought his signs in Egypt, and his wonders in the field of Zoan:<sup title="wrought: Heb. set">12</sup></p>

<p>And had turned their rivers into blood; and their floods, that they could not drink.</p>

<p>He sent divers sorts of flies among them, which devoured them; and frogs, which destroyed them.</p>

<p>He gave also their increase unto the caterpiller, and their labour unto the locust.</p>

<p>He destroyed their vines with hail, and their sycomore trees with frost.<sup title="destroyed: Heb. killed">13</sup><sup title="frost: or, great hailstones">14</sup></p>

<p>He gave up their cattle also to the hail, and their flocks to hot thunderbolts.<sup title="gave…: Heb. shut up">15</sup><sup title="hot…: or, lightnings">16</sup></p>

<p>He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, and indignation, and trouble, by sending evil angels among them.</p>

<p>He made a way to his anger; he spared not their soul from death, but gave their life over to the pestilence;<sup title="He made…: Heb. He weighed a path">17</sup><sup title="life…: or, beasts to the murrain">18</sup></p>

<p>And smote all the firstborn in Egypt; the chief of their strength in the tabernacles of Ham:</p>

<p>But made his own people to go forth like sheep, and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.</p>

<p>And he led them on safely, so that they feared not: but the sea overwhelmed their enemies.<sup title="overwhelmed: Heb. covered">19</sup></p>

<p>And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary, even to this mountain, which his right hand had purchased.</p>

<p>He cast out the heathen also before them, and divided them an inheritance by line, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.</p>

<p>Yet they tempted and provoked the most high God, and kept not his testimonies:</p>

<p>But turned back, and dealt unfaithfully like their fathers: they were turned aside like a deceitful bow.</p>

<p>For they provoked him to anger with their high places, and moved him to jealousy with their graven images.</p>

<p>When God heard this, he was wroth, and greatly abhorred Israel:</p>

<p>So that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent which he placed among men;</p>

<p>And delivered his strength into captivity, and his glory into the enemy’s hand.</p>

<p>He gave his people over also unto the sword; and was wroth with his inheritance.</p>

<p>The fire consumed their young men; and their maidens were not given to marriage.<sup title="given…: Heb. praised">20</sup></p>

<p>Their priests fell by the sword; and their widows made no lamentation.</p>

<p>Then the Lord awaked as one out of sleep, and like a mighty man that shouteth by reason of wine.</p>

<p>And he smote his enemies in the hinder parts: he put them to a perpetual reproach.</p>

<p>Moreover he refused the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim:</p>

<p>But chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which he loved.</p>

<p>And he built his sanctuary like high palaces, like the earth which he hath established for ever.<sup title="established: Heb. founded">21</sup></p>

<p>He chose David also his servant, and took him from the sheepfolds:</p>

<p>From following the ewes great with young he brought him to feed Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance.<sup title="following: Heb. after">22</sup></p>

<p>So he fed them according to the integrity of his heart; and guided them by the skilfulness of his hands.</p>

<p>He is the LORD our God: his judgments are in all the earth.</p>

<p>He hath remembered his covenant for ever, the word which he commanded to a thousand generations.</p>

<p>Which covenant he made with Abraham, and his oath unto Isaac;</p>

<p>And confirmed the same unto Jacob for a law, and to Israel for an everlasting covenant:</p>

<p>They forgat God their saviour, which had done great things in Egypt;</p>

<p>Wondrous works in the land of Ham, and terrible things by the Red sea.</p>

<p>Then stood up Phinehas, and executed judgment: and so the plague was stayed.</p>

<p>And that was counted unto him for righteousness unto all generations for evermore.</p>

<p>They angered him also at the waters of strife, so that it went ill with Moses for their sakes:</p>

<p>They did not destroy the nations, concerning whom the LORD commanded them:</p>

<p>Yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto devils,</p>

<p>And shed innocent blood, even the blood of their sons and of their daughters, whom they sacrificed unto the idols of Canaan: and the land was polluted with blood.</p>

<p>Thus were they defiled with their own works, and went a whoring with their own inventions.</p>

<p>Therefore was the wrath of the LORD kindled against his people, insomuch that he abhorred his own inheritance.</p>

<p>And he gave them into the hand of the heathen; and they that hated them ruled over them.</p>

<p>Praise ye the LORD. Sing unto the LORD a new song, and his praise in the congregation of saints.<sup title="Praise…: Heb. Hallelujah">1</sup></p>

<p>Let Israel rejoice in him that made him: let the children of Zion be joyful in their King.<sup title="in him…: Heb. in his Makers">2</sup></p>

<p>Let them praise his name in the dance: let them sing praises unto him with the timbrel and harp.<sup title="in…: or, with the pipe">3</sup></p>

<p>For the LORD taketh pleasure in his people: he will beautify the meek with salvation.</p>

<p>Let the saints be joyful in glory: let them sing aloud upon their beds.</p>

<p>Let the high praises of God be in their mouth, and a twoedged sword in their hand;<sup title="mouth: Heb. throat">4</sup></p>

<p>To execute vengeance upon the heathen, and punishments upon the people;</p>

<p>To bind their kings with chains, and their nobles with fetters of iron;</p>

<p>To execute upon them the judgment written: this honour have all his saints. Praise ye the LORD.</p>

<h4 class="passage">Psalm 150</h4>

<p>Praise ye the LORD. Praise God in his sanctuary: praise him in the firmament of his power.<sup title="Praise ye…: Heb. Hallelujah">1</sup></p>

<p>Praise him for his mighty acts: praise him according to his excellent greatness.</p>

<p>Praise him with the sound of the trumpet: praise him with the psaltery and harp.<sup title="trumpet: or, cornet">2</sup></p>

<p>Praise him with the timbrel and dance: praise him with stringed instruments and organs.<sup title="dance: or, pipe">3</sup></p>

<p>Praise him upon the loud cymbals: praise him upon the high sounding cymbals.</p>

<p>Let every thing that hath breath praise the LORD. Praise ye the LORD.</p>
